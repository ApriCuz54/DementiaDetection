# DementiaDetection

This repository contains the following projects that I personally worked on as part of a larger effort to detect dementia using machine learning:

- **Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa**: Demonstrates the power of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks by performing sentiment analysis using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model.
  
- **Deep Learning on DementiaBank Pitt Corpus**: Explores and tests various deep learning architectures on the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus dataset, aiming to detect linguistic patterns indicative of cognitive decline.
  
- **Preliminary Paper**: Includes the preliminary paper we drafted to present our findings and methods to our professor.

This project is still a work in progress, with ongoing efforts to refine and improve our models and techniques.
